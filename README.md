# Flower Classification Project

## Overview

This project involves classifying images of flowers using three different algorithms: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest, and K-Means clustering. The dataset consists of images of five types of flowers: roses, dandelions, sunflowers, daisies, and tulips. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and effectiveness.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises flower images organized into five categories:

- Roses
- Dandelions
- Sunflowers
- Daisies
- Tulips

The total dataset contains 4,317 images with a combined size of 228 MB. 

## Algorithms

### 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The CNN model demonstrates the best performance in classifying flower images. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image-related tasks due to their ability to automatically learn and extract features from images. This results in high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 2. Random Forest

The Random Forest model shows moderate performance. Although it achieves reasonable precision and recall, its overall accuracy and F1 score are lower compared to the CNN. Random Forest captures some patterns in the data but does not perform as well in distinguishing between different flower classes.

### 3. K-Means Clustering

K-Means clustering performs the least effectively for this classification task. The clustering evaluation metrics reveal poor accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, indicating challenges in classifying flower images. The K-Means clustering method also exhibits issues with cluster cohesion and separation.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- **Precision**: Indicates the proportion of true positive results among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Reflects the proportion of true positive results among all actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: Combines precision and recall into a single metric to evaluate the model's performance.

## Summary

- **CNN**: Most effective algorithm with high accuracy and balanced performance across metrics.
- **Random Forest**: Offers moderate performance but falls short compared to CNN.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Struggles considerably in this classification context with poor clustering evaluation metrics.
